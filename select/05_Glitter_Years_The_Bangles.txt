Denny was workin' it real hard
Down Sunset Boulevard
Back in 1973
Why would he bother going home?
His parents left him on his own
Who knows, maybe they were out gettin' stoned

I don't really know
How we survived the glitter years?
What did we do it all for?
(Aaa)
Do you remember the glitter years?
(Aaa)

(Ooo)
We were the lost and lonely ones
We hid in the discotheques all night long
'Till we could see the morning sun
(Aaa)
Denny was king, he'd rock the place
(Aaa)
Dressed like a working girl from outer space
(Aaa)
He was dancing like he wanted to dance his life away

I don't really know
How we survived the glitter years?
What did we do it all for?
(Aaa)
Do you remember the glitter years?
(Aaa)

In December of '74
Denny wrecked his father's car
Drivin' home that night he was singin'
(Singin')
You better hang on to yourself
You better hang on to yourself

I don't really know
How we survived the glitter years?
(Aaa)
I don't really know
(Aaa)
I don't really know
(Aaa)

(Surprise)
I don't really know
(Aaa)
How we survived the glitter years?
(Aaa)
I don't really know
(Aaa)
(Aaa aaa)

(Surprise)
I don't really know
(Aaa)
And I don't wanna be
(Aaa)
I don't really know
(Aaa)
(Aaa)
